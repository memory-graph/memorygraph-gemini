### Hacker News
**Title**:
```
MemoryGraph for Gemini CLI: The First Persistent Memory Extension
```

**Description**:
```
MemoryGraph brings persistent, graph-based memory to Gemini CLI. It's the first MCP-based memory extension for Google's AI coding tool.

Key features:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Graph relationships (problems → solutions)
- Cross-project learning
- Complements Conductor's context-driven dev

Works locally (SQLite) or syncs via cloud. Apache 2.0 licensed.
```

### Reddit (r/programming)
**Title**:
```
I built the first persistent memory extension for Gemini CLI - your AI now learns from past work
```

**Post**:
```
Hey r/programming!

I just launched MemoryGraph - the first persistent memory extension for Gemini CLI (Google's AI coding tool).

**The Problem**: AI forgets everything when the session ends. You solve a tricky bug today, hit the same problem next week, and your AI has no memory of the solution.

**The Solution**: MemoryGraph gives your AI persistent, graph-based memory.

Key features:
- Knowledge persists across sessions and projects
- Graph relationships connect problems to solutions
- Cross-project learning (solve once, apply everywhere)
- Perfect complement to Conductor's context-driven development
- Works locally (SQLite) or syncs via cloud

Example workflow:
```bash
# Today: solve a problem
> Store: Fixed N+1 query using selectinload(). Tag: sqlalchemy, performance

# Next week: similar issue
> What do I know about SQLAlchemy performance?
# MemoryGraph recalls your solution
```

It's open source (Apache 2.0), uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and works with any MCP-compatible AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

Would love your feedback!

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

```
MemoryGraph is the first persistent memory extension for Gemini CLI.

Your AI now remembers solutions across sessions, connects problems to fixes,
and transfers knowledge between projects.

It's like giving your AI a personal knowledge graph that gets smarter over time.

Perfect complement to Conductor - when you archive old tracks, the patterns
you discovered don't disappear. They become searchable, reusable knowledge.

Works locally or syncs via cloud. Open source, Apache 2.0.

## 💬 FAQ Responses

**Q: How is this different from Conductor?**
A: Complementary! Conductor excels at project-local context and task tracking. MemoryGraph adds cross-project, persistent memory. Better together.

**Q: Does this work with other AI tools?**
A: Yes! MemoryGraph uses MCP (Model Context Protocol), so it works with Claude Code CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue.dev, and any MCP-compatible tool.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Absolutely. Default backend is local SQLite. Cloud sync is optional. You control your data.

**Q: What happens to my memories when I switch projects?**
A: They persist! That's the whole point. Your authentication pattern from Project A is searchable in Project B.

**Q: How do I store memories?**
A: Just use natural language: "Store this solution: ..." or "Remember that...". The AI handles the rest.

**Q: What if I have 1000s of memories?**
A: MemoryGraph uses semantic search with fuzzy matching. It finds relevant memories even with large knowledge graphs.

## 🔥 Competitor Positioning

**Current State**: No direct competitors yet (first-mover!)

**Potential Future Competitors**:
- Other Gemini CLI memory extensions (none exist yet)
- Conductor expansions (complementary, not competitive)
- Generic MCP memory servers (we're specialized for Gemini)

**Defensive Moat**:
1. First-mover advantage
2. Conductor integration story
3. Graph-based relationships (not just flat storage)
4. Platform-agnostic via MCP
5. Community and documentation
