## 🎯 Marketing Messages (from Workplan)

### Primary Message
**"First Memory Extension for Gemini CLI"** - Use this EVERYWHERE

### Supporting Messages
1. **"Memory that persists when Conductor archives"**
   - Conductor archives old tracks → knowledge disappears
   - MemoryGraph captures patterns → searchable forever

2. **"Cross-project intelligence for AI coding"**
   - Learn in Project A → Apply in Project B
   - Universal knowledge graph

3. **"The memory layer for any AI coding tool"**
   - Works with Gemini CLI ✓
   - Works with Claude Code CLI ✓
   - Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Continue.dev ✓
   - Platform-agnostic via MCP

4. **"Conductor's missing long-term memory"**
   - Complement, not compete
   - Better together messaging

## 📝 Blog Post Key Excerpts (Ready to Copy)

### For Social Media

**Twitter Thread Starter** (280 chars):
```
🎉 Announcing MemoryGraph for Gemini CLI - the FIRST persistent memory extension for Google's AI coding tool!

Your AI now remembers solutions across sessions, connects problems to fixes, and transfers knowledge between projects.

🧵 Thread:
```

**Hacker News Title**:
```
MemoryGraph for Gemini CLI: The First Persistent Memory Extension
```

**Reddit Post Title**:
```
I built the first persistent memory extension for Gemini CLI - your AI now learns from past work
```

## 🎬 Demo Workflow Examples (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Archive to Learn (Post-Conductor)
```bash
# After completing a Conductor track
> Extract key learnings from this track and store them in MemoryGraph
> Tag those memories with: project-alpha, fastapi, authentication, jwt

# Next project
> Show me authentication patterns from project-alpha
```

### Debug with Memory
```bash
# Hit an error
> I'm getting "RuntimeError: Event loop is closed". Have I seen this?

# MemoryGraph recalls the fix
> Use asyncio.run() instead of loop.run_until_complete()
```

### Cross-Project Patterns
```bash
# In Project A
> Store pattern: FastAPI background tasks use Depends() for DB sessions

# In Project B
> What FastAPI background task patterns do I know?
# MemoryGraph finds the pattern from Project A
```

## 📢 First-Mover Positioning (Everywhere!)

Use this exact phrase consistently across all materials:

> **MemoryGraph is the first persistent memory extension for Gemini CLI.**

Variations:
- "The first MCP-based memory extension for Google's AI coding tool"
- "The first persistent memory for Gemini CLI"
- "First-mover in Gemini CLI memory extensions"

**Why it matters**: No competition yet. Define the category. Own the positioning.
